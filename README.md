# The Ultimate Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer data, performing data cleaning, feature engineering, and generating insightful reports. The goal is to segment the customers based on their purchasing behavior and generate useful insights that could inform business decisions. By following a series of steps, we load, clean, transform, and aggregate the data using Python and Pandas.

## Task Objective
The task is to load customer data from a CSV file, perform data cleaning and transformation, apply feature engineering techniques, group and filter the data, and ultimately generate a processed report and exported file.


## Installation

### Required Libraries:
To run the project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- datetime

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy

## How to Use

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KhadijahAgboola/data-wrangling-Khadijat-Agboola.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd customer-segmentation-analysis
    ```
3. **Install the required libraries:**
    Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Alternatively, you can install the libraries manually:
    ```bash

    ```
4. **Run the script in your Python environment:**
    ```bash
    python customer_segmentation_analysis.py
    ```
5. **View the results:**
    - The processed data will be saved as `processed_data_DD_MM_YYYY.csv`.
    - You can open the CSV file to see the cleaned and transformed data.
    - The markdown report will be automatically generated with the insights from the analysis.
